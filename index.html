              <strong>The first web browser - <em>WorldWideWeb</em></strong>.<br>
              WorldWideWeb was released in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee when he was working at CERN and renamed to Nexus later. <br>
              The browser was more like a browser-editor with graphical features at that time and it could only be used on NeXT computers. <br>

              <strong>Internet Explorer 1.0</strong> and the Browser Wars<br>
              In order to compete with Netscape, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 1.0 and started a Browser War. <br>
              In its first version, Internet Explorer is mostly licensed code from Spyglass Mosaic, though this is eventually rewritten. 
              It lacked crucial features, but subsequent versions of Internet Explorer would see marked improvements. <br>
              <strong>HTML 2.0</strong><br>
              HTML 2.0 contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features, 
              which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.<br>
              <strong>JavaScript 1.0</strong><br>
              Netscape created and released JavaScript with their browser. <br>
              The language is originally developed by Brendan Eich in the months prior, and soon became a novel, foundational, language of the web. 
              JavaScript gave websites powful computing capabilities they never have before.

              The new specification includes several features already implemented in browsers such as tables, superscripts, advanced forms, and more. 
              Much of this version of HTML is still in use today. <br>
              <strong>ECMAScript</strong><br>
              ECMA releases an official standard for ECMAScript, based off the work being done with JavaScript. <br>
              Netscape had developed JavaScript in the years before, but wished to standardize to avoid being the sole maintainer. 
              ECMAScript draws heavily from version of JavaScript implemented in the Netscape browser, with some improvements.

              XML is used heavily in web services, and allows for web servers and clients to exchange information back and forth programatically.

              having one large single specification defining various features. 
              Due to the modularization, different modules have different stability and statuses. <br>
